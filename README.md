# Sonic 3K Decompiled code

# Well... what's this?
Exactly what it says it is - this is a collection of reverse-engineered S3O code.

This repo is *not* a full/complete decomp of Sonic 3K, but rather just a few objects, incase you were wondering what they'd look like, or if you wanted to port the 3K titlecard to mania for some reason, i dunno

Currently (and most likely forever) - you can't use this code as a way to play Sonic 3K on the RSDKv5U decomp, since yknow, it's missing... literally everything

This code is not meant to be built as its own dll/library, you're meant to include it in an existing project

Don't be surprised if some stuff is incomplete, missing, or broken

Also - be aware that there just might be random modifications to the code (most of it came from my S3 project), i've been updating the repo to remove leftovers from it

have fun i guess, don't start a full sonic 3 decomp without me thanks

# ... also!
Don't be stupid with it - you can't sell the code, or make any profits (whatsoever) with it
